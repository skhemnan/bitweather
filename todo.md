# TODO

* Follow Tutorial (done)
* Position/forms
  - Figure out how to position all weather information on bottom left or bottom right of screen (with padding)
  - Figure out how to dynamically change the button into a text field, by expanding the button. (Failing that, maybe just have a text box appear when button is tapped/clicked)
* Background
  - Find multiple weather backgrounds in 8bit (failing that just do landscape)
  - Create custom "BitWeather" start background
  - Figure out how to change background based on weather pulled from API (Groups)
  - Figure out how to make night/day based on time of day
* Switch between celsius and Farenheit
  - Figure out how to toggle between celsius and farenheit
  - Figure out how to get state name instead of country if US (probably not going to work because of API)
* Font Awesome icon for search
